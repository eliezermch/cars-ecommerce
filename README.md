# Cars E-commerce

This is a Cars e-commerce using **React** and **react-router-dom**. I make this app to practice and improve my skills in **TypeScript** and **React**.

- TypeScript
- Calls APIs
- React good practices.
- Componentization.
- Good file and folder structures.
- Global Context and optimizations.
- React Hooks.
- Custom Hooks.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

for installing all dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
